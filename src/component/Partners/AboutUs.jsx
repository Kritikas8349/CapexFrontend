    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>
        Founded in Auckland, New Zealand in 2014, our founders aimed to provide retail investors with a high-quality trading experience â€“ a level of service that was rarely accessible at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our team has accomplished this by creating advanced trading technologies, including proprietary in-house trade-order management systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        To complement our robust technology and competitive pricing, we offer professional services that elevate the trading experience for our clients.
